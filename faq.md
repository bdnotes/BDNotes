### Q: On average, how long do notes take to be approved?
Depends mostly on how busy the maintainers are with school at that point :)  
But seriously, anywhere from the same day to several days afterwards. Just remember that we have homework and tests, same as you.

### Q: How can I see when my note was approved?
Check the [list of pull requests](https://github.com/bdnotes/BDNotes/pulls) on github. If your PR appears in the "closed" section, it's been accepted. You can either check obsessively until this happens, or hit "watch" on the repository if you have a github account to be notified of all PR requests and closings.

### Q: You guys don't have a section for my class! What gives?
Maybe the class got added, removed, or renamed in the school curriculum. Maybe we missed it. Maybe we decided it wasn't a class people take notes for (think PE), and not worth putting up on the site. If you have any questions about a class being missing, [contact us]({{site.baseurl}}/contact).

### Q: What are these "Lecture" things when submitting notes?
Classes on the site are organized into lectures, which correspond roughly one to one with a real class' lessons. So the first lesson of the year in Analysis 1B, on polar, would be given an appropriate title ("Area in Polar") to be used when displaying notes on class pages.

### Q: This site is great, but it really needs [xyz]
Glad you think so! You can either [contact us]({{site.baseurl}}/contact) and have it done ~~at some point~~ probably never, or clone our repo and do it yourself. We welcome pull requests with improvements :)
