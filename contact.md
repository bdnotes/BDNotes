### Report an Issue
The formal (and preferred) way to report a missing link or class etc. is to [open a github issue](https://github.com/bdnotes/BDNotes/issues/new). If you can't be bothered to make a github account, you can email us: {{site.email}}

### Suggestions or Discussions
Again, the formal and preferred way to do this is with a new issue on github. Failing that, we welcome comments through our email.

### Something Personal
Do you want one of your notes taken down for personal reasons? Are you a teacher and want a one on one with us about the way this site is being used? (hah, as if teachers would ever know about us, but we can dream)

Please email us! Anything private should not be posted as an issue on github.

### Contact
To warp it up;

* Issues/Suggestions: [open a github issue](https://github.com/bdnotes/BDNotes/issues/new)
* Personal/No github account: [email us](mailto:{{site.email}})
