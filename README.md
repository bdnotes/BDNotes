# BDNotes
A shared magnet notes repository that any Blair student can contribute to.

## Coverage
There are classes available for the core magnet curriculum (ie, magnet only classes) and electives or APs typically taken by magnets (AP Physics, Quantum, Astronomy, Linear Algebra, Discrete, etc). A full list can be found under the classes directory, or on the live site.

## Contact
To request an addition to the class list, report a broken link on the site, or leave feedback, you can either open an issue here on github or email us at blairdiscordnotes@gmail.com.
